# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for [the 2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

To run a puzzle, simply execute the program with the day number as a parameter.
For instance, to run the puzzle for the first day, run:

```shell
❯ cargo run 1
   Compiling advent2023 v0.1.0 (/home/romain/dev/advent/advent2023)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 3.51s
     Running `target/debug/advent2023 1`
